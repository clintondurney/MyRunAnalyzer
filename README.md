MyRunAnalyzer
=============

Providing functionality that Garmin Connect and Strava do not provide for my fitness goals.

This project's goals are to:

1.  Analyze running data from a Garmin GPS watch gaining metrics that current sites (e.g. Garmin Connect,
	Strava, etc.) do not currently provide.  These will be based on my personal fitness goals at
	this time.  

2.  As a way to become proficient in Python through actual use of the programming language.

3.  Become better at analyzing data through calculations and data presentation.

4.  Connect with skilled programmers who can critique my code and help.

5.  Any comments, criticisms or requests are welcome.
